## Statically typed language

Solidity is a statically typed language. This means that the type of each of the variables should be specified, and variables cannot change type during runtime (e.g. variable `_value` cannot first hold a Boolean and then an integer)

> Statically typed programming languages perform type checking during the course of compilation rather than during run time, which makes programs written in these languages run much faster.

## Solidity Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

The primary Solidity IDE is [Remix](remix.md), which is available both as a web-browser and a desktop application.

Some plug-ins ([Example 1](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity), [Example 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ConsenSys.Solidity)) for VS Code exist, but none are officially supported and functionality appears limited compare to what Remix offers.
