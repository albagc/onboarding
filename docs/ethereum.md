### Ether

### Consensus mechanisms

Proof of work, vs proof of stake, vs proof of authority

Ethereum is moving from proof-of-work (current) to proof-of-stake (new) - see [Test network](#test-networks) section for more details.

### Test networks

Many different test networks for the Ethereum blockchain exist, and they have different underlying approaches:

* Ropsten (_proof of work_) - see [here](metamask.md#ether-faucets) for a list of faucets for this network.
* Kovan
* Rinkeby
* Goerli
* Kintsugi (_proof of stake_) - note that this network was only formally released in December 2021, and so is not yet available via Metamask by default. See [here](https://etherworld.co/2021/12/20/how-to-join-ethereum-merge-kintsugi-testnet/) details on how to add the Kintsugi testnet to Metamask.
