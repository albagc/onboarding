## Decentralized file storage
### Context

Today, resources are allocated in a certain url address, hosted in a certain server. This _location based addressing_ system is centralized, and it exposes the whole file storage online system to the threats related to centralisation: single-point cyberattacks, data monopoly, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/world/europe/turkey-wikipedia-access-restored.html" target="_blank"> censorship</a>, etc.

The InterPlanetary File System aims to build a distributed internet.
