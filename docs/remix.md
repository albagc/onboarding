Remix uses <a href=""> Solidity </a> to implement smart contracts working integrated with the Ethereum blockchain protocol. It offers environments to confect the contracts as an IDE and a Desktop app. 

It has several libraries for debugging, security and vulnerability analysis or testing the integration of the contracts with the tools where they will be used to regulate the transactions.
